  "name": "Agumon",
  "description": "Agumon is a Reptile Digimon. It is a Digimon that’s developed the ability to walk on two legs, similar in appearance to a tiny dinosaur. Since Agumon isn’t fully matured, it lacks strength, but its fierce disposition makes it reckless. Hard, sharp claws grow from its limbs, and Agumon makes full use of them in battle. Agumon shows much potential, promising Digivolution into a great and powerful Digimon. "
