  "name": "CrysPaledramon",
  "description": "CrysPaledramon is a Dragonkin Digimon. It is a Digimon that only a select few Paledramon are said to be able to digivolve into. The shell of ice it has grown has changed into armor that covers its entire body, drastically raising its defensive and offensive power. Thanks to the icicles mounted on its wings, it now remains unchanged when facing any hot Digimon. Also, it can even control air currents due to the cold air it blasts from its thrusters, allowing it to fly at higher speeds even during snowstorms. "
