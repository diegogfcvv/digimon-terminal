  "description": "Sandmon is a Slime Digimon. Its body is made of sand. It has an aggressive personality despite being a Fresh, and is strongly territorial. It has an amorphous body which can disperse like sand or conversely harden like clay, but its pacifier alone is unable to change shape in any way. When opponents approach it throws a lot of sand to intimidate them. "
