  "description": "Dracomon was originally designed to have a third, \"Yellow\" line, which would be designed as the \"Almighty Dragon\" ( 全能竜 , Zen'nouryū ? ) ruling over both heaven and earth, alongside the blue \"Heavenly Dragon\" ( 天竜 , Tenryū ? ) and green \"Earthly Dragon\" ( 地竜 , Jiryū ? ) lines. Slayerdramon was originally intended to be the Mega form of this line, as opposed to the Blue line which originally used Examon . "
