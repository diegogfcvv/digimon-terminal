  "name": "Megadramon",
  "description": "Megadramon is a orange-brown dragon with blue hair and yellow eyes. It has two tattered purple wings with some parts stitched, two arms, and no legs. It wears a black metallic helmet with two triangular horns extruding from the back of it on its head, and a black robotic gauntlet with three large metal claws on each of its arms, from which blue organic missiles are fired.  Each of the shark-like organic missile has two arms, six red fins, a white nose tip, a mouth full of sharp teeth, but no eyes. In the Battle!! Digimon manhua series, its helmet has only one horn instead of two."
