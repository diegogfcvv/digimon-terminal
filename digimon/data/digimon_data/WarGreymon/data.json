  "name": "WarGreymon",
  "description": "WarGreymon is a Dragon Digimon. The strongest dragon warrior whose body is clad in armor of the super-metal \" Chrome Digizoid \", it is the ultimate form of Greymon-species Digimon. Though it differs from the gigantic figure seen in Greymon-species Digimon, and has the form of a Man-type, it has rapidly improved its speed and power, and it is likely impossible to defeat it with the attacks of an Ultimate Digimon. The \"Dramon Destroyers\" ( Dramon Killers ) equipped to both of its arms exhibit immense power against Dramon -species Digimon, while simultaneously being double-edged swords that put its own life at great risk. Also, when the shells equipped on its back unite into one, they become the \"Brave Shield\", which is a shield of the strongest toughness. It is said that the moment that a true hero among veteran warriors awakens to its own mission, it digivolves into WarGreymon. "
