  "description": "ShineGreymon Burst Mode looks like an enhanced version of ShineGreymon , replacing all golden parts of its armor with red, the fin on its helmet has gotten bigger, it lost all the spikes it retained in its previous form. Its wings are now made of fire, and the tip of its tail has been replaced with a lit flame. It also wields a flame sword and a flame shield."
