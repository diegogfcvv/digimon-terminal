  "description": "Hiyarimon is a Lesser Digimon. It is a Digimon that digivolved from YukimiBotamon . The once fluffy cilia are gone, and instead the surface of its body is always covered with snow. It lives mostly in snowy mountains, and its body melts when exposed to sunlight, so it is active after sunset. It seems that the bigger the icicle is that hangs from the tip of its beak, the more energized it is. "
