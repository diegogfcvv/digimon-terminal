  "name": "Demon",
  "description": "Daemon is a Demon Lord Digimon. It is one of the \" Seven Great Demon Lords \", representing Jupiter and the sin of Wrath . It leads the many Devil and Fallen Angel Digimon, and like Devimon , it was originally an Angel Digimon, and a particularly high-ranking one. It is said that before it fell to the Dark Area and became a Demon Lord Digimon, it was in fact a Seraphimon .  However, because it raged in fury or rebellion against a being of goodness in the Digital World (perhaps the very human that created the Digital World), it was deleted to the Dark Area . It has vowed to one day conquer the Digital World in revenge against the being of goodness. Also, it is plotting to secretly revive Lucemon Chaos Mode who led the rebellion and was the strongest among the Megas. "
