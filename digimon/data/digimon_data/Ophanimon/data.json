  "description": "Ophanimon is an Angel Digimon. As one of the \" Celestial Digimon \", it is a Holy Mother -like being who imparts the loving and merciful side of God . It is the final form of feminine Angel Digimon.  It was responsible for banishing the former Angel-species Cho-Hakkaimon from heaven for an unspecified crime,  but it's also thought that Lilithmon , who fell from heaven and became known as the \"Goddess of Darkness\", was itself originally an Ophanimon.
