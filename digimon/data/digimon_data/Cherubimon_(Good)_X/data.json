  "name": "Cherubimon_(Good)_X",
  "description": "Cherubimon (Good) X is a Cherub Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . It accumulates endless light energy in its abdomen, and when Cherubimon hugs a pure Digimon, its true potential seems to be unleashed. However, if the Digimon has a wicked heart, their evil spirit is replaced by light and they revert back into a Digi-Egg from which they will emerge as a good Digimon. Evil Digimon that Cherubimon has given up on will be extinguished with \"Biririn Hug You\". "
