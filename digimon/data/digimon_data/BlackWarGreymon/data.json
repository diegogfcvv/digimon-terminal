  "name": "BlackWarGreymon",
  "description": "BlackWarGreymon is a Dragonkin Digimon. Feared as the \"Jet-black Dragon Warrior\", it is a Virus-species WarGreymon . Although its creed and principles are the polar opposite of those of the Virus Buster WarGreymon, it exists for the sake of its own peculiar justice. It detests cowardice and foul play, and it doesn't consider itself a fellow of vulgar Digimon, even if they are of the same Virus-species. The full details of how it converted to a Virus are a mystery, and the \"Brave Shield\" equipped to its back is not engraved with the Crest of Courage . "
