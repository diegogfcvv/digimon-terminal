  "name": "HiAndromon",
  "description": "HiAndromon's appearance is simply a more-refined version of Andromon. All parts exposed or incomplete are covered, with both those and the armor already present on the body taking on a black coloration, the helmet taking on the armor's coloration and shields the eyes exposed from its previous form. The pauldrons now possess both more-refined appearances and separate colors, while the armor has red wires across the joints and limbs. A new addition to HiAndromon's arsenal is the addition of energy-powered blades to use in an attack originally done with Andromon's hand."
