  "description": "Zubamon is a bipedal reptilian creature with red eyes, a tail, and three digits on its hands and feet. It wears a golden armor that covers most of its body, and a white cape. Its armor has a claw at each digit, a black losangle-shaped object in the tail, a small blade-like object on each knee, an orange \"0\" on its left shoulder pad, and a sword-like horn on its helmet. The horn emits a blue light on its blade, and it has a silver \"20\" on its left side."
