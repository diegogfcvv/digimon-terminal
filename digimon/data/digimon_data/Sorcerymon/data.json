  "name": "Sorcerymon",
  "description": "Sorcerymon looks like an icy and holy version of Wizardmon , shifting its color palette to white and light blue. Its hat lacks the large skull on Wizardmon's, while its staff is snowflake-shaped compared to Wizardmon's sun, reflecting its water and ice powers. The DigiCode on its cape are randomly arranged, and read デジタルモンスター ( デジタルモンスター , Dejitaru Monsutā ? , lit. \"Digital Monster\") ."
