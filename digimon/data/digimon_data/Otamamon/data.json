  "name": "Otamamon",
  "description": "Otamamon is an Amphibian Digimon. It is a larva Digimon whose skin has not yet fully hardened because it chose to live underwater. It swims in lakes and rivers upstream of the Net Ocean with its large tail, and occasionally climbs up onto rocks with its developed forelimbs and does vocal training . Its mostly undeveloped hind limbs act as rudders in place of its tail, which has gained propulsive power, contrary to typical organisms. It is valuable among Rookie levels in that it signals its upcoming digivolution clearly, but since its potential for mutation is extremely high, caution is necessary in its training. "
