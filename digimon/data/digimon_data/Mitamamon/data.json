  "name": "Mitamamon",
  "description": "Mitamamon is a God Beast Digimon. It is a holy Digimon that is said to send the souls of Digimon who have carried out good deeds in their previous lives to Heaven. A collection of the four energies of fire, earth, wind and water, it lacks actual substance except for its Digicore. Despite being visible, it cannot be touched; only those who have been recognized by Mitamamon itself or Digimon who are on the verge of death are allowed to touch it. However, those who have figured out where Mitamamon's Digicore is can also touch it, so there are occasions when it is challenged to battle by extremely rare yet rough-tempered Digimon. Because Mitamamon has a calm personality and despises conflict, it often ignores battles it has been challenged to. However, as for those who have incurred its wrath once, Mitamamon changes into a raging beast that deals a crushing blow to them without mercy. "
