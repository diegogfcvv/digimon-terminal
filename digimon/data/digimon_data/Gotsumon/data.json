  "name": "Gotsumon",
  "description": "Gotsumon is a Rock Digimon. It is a Digimon with powerful defensive abilities, having armored itself using ore data from its surroundings. Spunky, mischievous, and ambitious as any young tough guy, it leads around groups of low-generation Digimon as it travels the system. It also has a selfish side, and can be a real handful when angered, rampaging like an erupting volcano. Depending on where and how it forms, the ore data it uses for armor may appear different, and it has the potential to Digivolve into a number of different forms. "
