  "name": "Knightmon",
  "description": "Knightmon is a Warrior Digimon. It is a largely-built Digimon whose body is clad in armor made from heavyweight Chrome Digizoid . It possesses enough power to easily wield its cherished greatsword even while dressed in that armor. According to one theory, it wears the armor on its body in order to restrain its mighty, uncontrollable power. Also, Knightmon is a Digimon that exists to faithfully serve its master, and its personality is deeply loyal. For that reason, it is in distress over becoming either wicked or righteous, depending on its master's attribute, in order to follow through on those convictions.  All Knightmon are presided over by their monarch, Crusadermon . "
