  "name": "Sunarizamon",
  "description": "Sunarizamon is a Reptile Digimon. It mainly acts in groups while camouflaging itself in desert areas. By regulating the volume of sand that composes its body, it is able to expand, contract, and transform its limbs and tail. It is difficult to identify its figure once it has blended in with the desert, and it is not unusual to think that there might be quicksand, but it ends up being a large group of Sunarizamon instead.  Herds of Sunarizamon work together to combat invaders alongside Landramon , who acts as something of a leader to the Sunarizamon and uses the vibrations of its cry to relay commands to the herd through the sand.
