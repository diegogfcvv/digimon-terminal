  "description": "Growlmon X is a Demon Dragon Digimon and carrier of the X Antibody . Because it has accepted and contained the extraordinary power of the \" Digital Hazard \" within itself, and that its attack instinct as a Virus-species enhanced further, it will exhibit a ferocious nature where it is unable to control its overflowing power, changing its personality into one on a thin line with justice depending on how it grows up. However, Growlmon's power has clearly increased, and the blades on both of its elbows have enlarged even more, developing and causing plasma to appear when attacking the enemy. "
