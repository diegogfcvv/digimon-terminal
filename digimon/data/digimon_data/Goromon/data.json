  "description": "Tumblemon is a Rock Digimon. It is an In-Training Digimon that grows by eating rocks. Because its digestive system is not fully developed yet, it stores an amount of ore in its body unimaginable given its small size, and gradually converts it into nourishment. The site in which its eye is located also serves as its mouth, and it seems to turn completely blind while eating. "
