  "name": "Troopmon",
  "description": "Troopmon is a humanoid Digimon wearing a black rubber suit that obscures most of its features. Its face is covered by a gas mask that has tubes connected to the pack on its back. It has three fingers on each hand with what appears to be ports at the fingertips, and its feet look mechanized, with three clawed toes on each. It is often equipped with a firearm vaguely reminiscent of an AK-47 or Thompson submachine gun ."
