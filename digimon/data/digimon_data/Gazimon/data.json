  "name": "Gazimon",
  "description": "Gazimon is a Mammal Digimon. It is a Digimon with large, sharp claws. It is bipedal, which is rare amongst Mammal types; the claws on its forelegs likely evolved to allow its forelegs to be used as arms, therefore resulting in its bipedalism. It has an extremely aggressive temperament despite its small size, and it never warms up to humans. Although the claws on its forelegs are very effective at attacking, they are also surprisingly suited to digging holes, which it always does as it enjoys watching other Digimon fall into its pitfalls due to its mischievous personality.
