  "description": "Impmon X is an altered version of Impmon that appears to take inspiration from the Japanese term Chunibyo . It wears an eye patch with a red X over its right eye, a belt with a yellow smiley face and its neckerchief has become more pronounced with a white X on the left end. Its right glove has changed color to blue, its left eye has become red and the tip of its tail is now red with a ring in it."
