  "name": "Piranimon",
  "description": "Piranimon is a Sea Animal Digimon. Piranimon is ferocious Digimon that acts in large schools . The exoskeleton covering its head amplifies the power of its jaws so that it can reliably bring down the enemy with its sharp fangs. That power is said to be equivalent to the force of a Mammothmon trampling with its feet. Since it attacks a single Digimon in schools, not a scrap of data is left behind after being assaulted by Piranimon. "
