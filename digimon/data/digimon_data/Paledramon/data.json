  "name": "Paledramon",
  "description": "Paledramon is a Dragon Digimon. It is a Digimon that digivolved from Bulucomon . Its large wings of ice allow it to fly at high speed, even in foul weather. Changes in temperature due to the environment no longer have an effect on its body, but when facing hot Digimon such as Meramon , its body will melt just like its Rookie form, causing its power to decrease. It has a strong sense of camaraderie, so if a Digimon who it has teamed up with falls into a crisis, it will try to help them out without considering the risks. "
