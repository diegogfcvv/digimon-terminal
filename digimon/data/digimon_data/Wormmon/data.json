  "description": "Wormmon's design draws influence from the Tomato hornworm ( Manduca quinquemaculata ). It is a small green caterpillar with a pair of long antennae and ten legs with pink claws. Like a real insect, Wormmon possesses the ability to adhere to surfaces and is also able to generate silk from its purple mandibles . It has a black band resembling a Dark Ring around its abdomen and two pink spines on the end of it."
