  "name": "Falcomon",
  "description": "Falcomon is an Avian Digimon. It lives on 3000m-tall mountains, but as its wings are not very developed, it's not so much able to fly, as it is to glide, so instead it's able to run about the craggy mountains at great speed, using its powerful leg strength. Because it has a rough temperament, you must be careful because if you approach carelessly, you will get fiercely attacked. "
