  "name": "Metallicdramon",
  "description": "Metallicdramon is a Sky Dragon Digimon. A Digimon that flies at the highest altitudes of the Digital World at the speed of light , even other flying Digimon cannot catch sight of it. According to one theory, it is said that if Metallicdramon flaps its wings from high in the sky, mysterious particles will be scattered that preserve the harmony of the Digital World. It seems that when Metallicdramon reduces its altitude so that it is visible, it is a sign that something is about to happen. "
