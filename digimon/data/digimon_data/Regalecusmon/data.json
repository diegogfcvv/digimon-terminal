  "name": "Regalecusmon",
  "description": "Regalecusmon is an Aquatic Digimon. It is an aloof Digimon that hates crowds. As a pirate who repeatedly assaults and loots the feeding grounds and territories of other Digimon, it is also the ruler of the abyss that stands at the apex of the food chain due to its overwhelming power. Its sword, made after tearing off a Zudomon 's horn, and the giant pincer on its left arm, are symbols of awe which strike fear into those who see them. "
