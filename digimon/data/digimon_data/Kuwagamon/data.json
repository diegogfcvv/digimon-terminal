  "name": "Kuwagamon",
  "description": "Kuwagamon is an Insectoid Digimon. It is armed with gigantic pincers on its head. Like Kabuterimon , it has combat abilities that far exceed those of similar species that inhabit File Island . It is protected by its tenacious power and sturdy shell, and in particular, as the power of its pincers is super-powerful, once it clamps an enemy, it will squeeze until the opponent's life is extinguished. There is a perfect rivalry between it and the Vaccine-attribute Kabuterimon, and there is only \"Conflict\" between them. "
