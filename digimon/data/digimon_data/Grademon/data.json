  "name": "Grademon",
  "description": "Grademon is a Warrior Digimon and a carrier of the X Antibody . It wields a pair of swords, and is called the \"Golden Meteor\" due to the way it cuts into the vanguard with dauntless courage. When it uses its \"Souken Gradalpha\" ( 双剣グレイダルファー , Souken Gureidarufā ? , lit. \"Twin Swords Gradalpha\")  along with its twin-sword style, it brings a godly speed to those techniques, but due to the cursed swords, it becomes impossible for it to control itself, and it can't fight and still retain its sanity. Although its overall power is, after all, inferior, its sword techniques surpass even the Holy Knight Crusadermon , of the \" Royal Knights \", and it is said that its royal blue mantle is proof of the honor that was bestowed for its achievements over many battles.
