  "name": "Seadramon",
  "description": "Seadramon is a Sea Animal Digimon. It has a long, serpentine body, which it uses to wreathe itself around enemies that are coming to attack, and constrict until the enemy suffocates. Naturally, it doesn't have intelligence or speech, and it swims around the Net Ocean leisurely according to its instincts. "
