  "description": "Crusadermon is a Warrior Digimon. One of the \" Royal Knights \", it is the monarch who presides over all Knightmon . Even more than to morality, Crusadermon is faithful to what it personally regards as \"Justice\", and those ends justify their means. If it will bring about lasting peace, Crusadermon will find merit in it, even in regards to \"Ruling through Strength\". In its entirety, it is uniquely ruthless in the execution of its duties, and it shows no compassion for the weak. "
