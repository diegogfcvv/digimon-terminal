  "name": "Hyougamon",
  "description": "Hyogamon is a Digimon that resembles a blue ogre with long, unkempt white hair, pointed ears adored by earrings, a single horn on its head and an icicle jutting from each of its shoulders. It's known for having its mouth open nearly all the time with an exaggerated lower jaw similar to Violator and has fang-like tusks on its upper jaw like a traditional Oni . It wears a black loincloth with a belt, black belts on its right arm, nothing on its left arm, blue bandages on its right leg, and black belts on its left leg. It carries an icicle as a weapon. It has a skull and crossbones on its left arm below its shoulder icicle, metal studs on the knuckles of its left hand, and a scar on the back of its right hand."
