  "description": "Justimon X is a Cyborg Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . It no longer needs to switch between its three Arms; they have become the \"Blitz Arm\" on its right arm, the \"Critical Arm\" on its left arm, and the \"Accel Leg\" on its left leg. Each piece of equipment appears on and is activated by its belt buckle, and it invokes a Special Move once it presses it again during activation. Furthermore, the \"ABC-sert\" that activates all three of them is extremely powerful, but its activity time is limited. "
