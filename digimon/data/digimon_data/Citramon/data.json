  "name": "Citramon",
  "description": "Citramon is an English dub-based redesign of BomberNanimon , who appeared as an antagonist in Digimon Data Squad , \" A Birthday Kristy Will Never Forget! \" . To avoid references to bombs blowing up amusement parks, Disney ordered Jeff Nimoy to either revise the character or cut the episode entirely, and as the episode was important to Thomas H. Norstein 's character development, they decided to revise the character into a fruit monster."
