  "description": "Chaosdramon is a Machine Digimon. It is said that Machinedramon , who was built by combining the parts of many Cyborg-species Digimon, demonstrated abilities beyond imagination, and that the experiment succeeded. Adding enhancements to further improve that Machinedramon made it Chaosdramon, who possesses a deep crimson Metal Body. Its body, which is made of \" Red Digizoid \" that was repurified from the virtual super-metal Chrome Digizoid and increased just its hardness, deflects every attack and destroys everything. Also, the version of the program that was set in its DigiCore automatically performs improvements to make it even more destructive. Chaosdramon is also the Digimon that the leader of the Crack Team primarily employs as its agent. "
