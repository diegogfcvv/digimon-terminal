  "description": "Sakuyamon is a Shaman Digimon. It holds the role of a miko , acting as an agent of God 's will. Like Taomon , it freely uses Onmyoudou techniques in battle, and has the ability to employ God Beast-species Digimon. It always carries four pipes on the belt around its waist, within which lurk four kuda-gitsune that possess the attributes of \"Fire\", \"Water\", \"Wind\", and \"Thunder\", respectively. It is able to use these kuda-gitsune for everything from attacking to gathering information. Just like MagnaAngemon (Priest Mode) , it is able to change into Sakuyamon Maid Mode , which administers Shinto rituals. It wields the \"Kongou Shakujou\" ( 金剛錫杖 , \"Kongou Shakujou\" ? lit. \" Vajra - Khakkhara \") .  Its gloves bear the Zero Unit , and the characters on the foreheads of the red, blue, green, and yellow kuda-gitsune read \"Fire\" ( 火 , Hi ? ) , \"Water\" ( 水 , Mizu ? ) , \"Wind\" ( 風 , Kaze ? ) , and \"Thunder\" ( 雷 , Kaminari ? ) , respectively."
