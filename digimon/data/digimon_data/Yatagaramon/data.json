  "name": "Yatagaramon",
  "description": "Crowmon (2006 anime) is derived from the Yatagarasu of Japanese myth, referencing its dark plumage, three legs, and association with divinity by the Dokkosho on its two wings which are on gold mountings with a large center point and prongs. The tips of its wings are purple while its talons are red. It has a gold mask with a long red crest, a red beak, purple feathered neck, and white ruff that is braided into a single rope that dangles freely with a bell to each side of it as well."
