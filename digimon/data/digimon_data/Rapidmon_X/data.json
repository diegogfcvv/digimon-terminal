  "name": "Rapidmon_X",
  "description": "Rapidmon X is a Holy Warrior Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . The power contained within the Digi-Egg of Destiny has been drawn out even further by the X-Antibody, so it is now capable of constantly exhibiting power at the Mega level. The armaments on both of its arms and back form the \"Armed Arms\"; when it comes to long distances, it rapid-fires its \"Rapid Blaster\", which has a low attenuation rate, and when it comes to short and medium distances, it rapid-fires its \"Laser Gatling Arm\", where it switches from the Armed Arms on its back. In addition, a booster function has also been added, allowing it to dive into the enemy's chest at high speed, and perform slash attacks with its claws. "
