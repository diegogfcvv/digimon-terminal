  "name": "Apocalymon",
  "description": "Apocalymon is an Unidentified Digimon. It is a Digimon who appeared when negative thoughts were drawn together by darkness. So little is known about Apocalymon that it may not even be a Digimon. Some claim it appeared to purge the chaos of cyberspace, and reduce it back to nothing; others claim its arrival was spoken of in ancient texts. "
