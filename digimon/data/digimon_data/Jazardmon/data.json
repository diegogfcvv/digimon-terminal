  "description": "Jazardmon is a Machine Dragon Digimon. It is a Digimon whose form mixes together the data of both a dragon and a fighter jet . In addition to being able to fly at high speed, it is also capable of vertical take-off and landing , as well as hovering thanks to its legs. It is a bit of an oddball in that its hobby is performing reconnaissance, so it will always have a good grasp of what is going on in its surroundings. It possesses night vision, thermal, ultrasound and other capabilities, and thus, it is impossible to approach it without being noticed. "
