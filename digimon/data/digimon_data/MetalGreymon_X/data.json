  "name": "MetalGreymon_X",
  "description": "MetalGreymon X is a Cyborg Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . Both its flesh portions and remodelled portions are perfectly well-balanced, possibly because of how intense the power it had obtained was. The \"Trident Arm VER 9.9\" on its left arm has a control program set in its DigiCore that has been upgraded to its limit, and possesses the energy equivalent of a single shot of \"Giga Destroyer\" in just one swing, so it is an offensive force that must never be endured in close combat.
