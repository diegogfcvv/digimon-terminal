  "description": "WarGrowlmon is a Cyborg Digimon. It possesses the name \"Gigantic Growlmon\". As its name suggests, its body has grown gigantic, and its upper body has been metallized with \" Chrome Digizoid \". It is able to take flight with the two vernier attached to its shoulders, so it is possible for it to perform both anti-air and anti-ground attacks. In order to restrain it from running wild due to excess power, a restraining tool similar to a bit is attached to its jaw section. Also, since the \"Assault Balancer\" extending like a cable from its back section is extensible, it can be used to impale the opponent. It has the \"Pendulum Blades\" equipped to its arms. "
