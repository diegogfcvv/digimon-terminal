  "name": "Togemon",
  "description": "Togemon is a Vegetation Digimon. It has the appearance of a gigantic cactus. It can store nutrient data within its body, and can even survive for a long time in the empty desert areas. What it's thinking usually can't be understood at all by trying to discern it from its facial expression, as it spends most of the day staring off into space. However, once Togemon is angered, that expression changes completely, it starts getting violent, and it becomes unable to settle down.  According to one theory, Togemon was originally a \"Plant Weapon\" used when a Vademon that was discovered and captured near a certain country's \" Area 51 \" invaded the planet, and was said to have started advancing toward every strategic base. However, as usual, Togemon's mysterious behavior has turned the truth into a mystery. Also, its connection to the rumor that Vademon was born from the \"seed of a plant\" is currently being studied.
