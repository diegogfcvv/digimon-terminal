  "name": "Gabumon_X",
  "description": "Gabumon X is an altered version of Gabumon that enhances it with mammalian traits in contrast to the reptilian appearance of the original, giving it a canine nose, comparatively longer legs, and a bushy, presumably more flexible tail. Gabumon X's pelt is modified, colored in a blue and striped with an even darker blue, lacking as many stripes but longer, silver claws at each end."
