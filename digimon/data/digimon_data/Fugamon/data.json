  "name": "Fugamon",
  "description": "Fugamon is a Digimon that resembles a red or ochre ogre with long, unkempt white hair and pointed ears adored by earrings. It's known for having its mouth open nearly all the time with an exaggerated lower jaw similar to Violator and has fang-like tusks on its upper jaw like a traditional Oni . It wears a tiger stripe loincloth and sleeves on its left arm and right leg which further emphasize this resemblance as well as a bracer on its right arm and black belts on its left leg. It carries a large, spiked femur bone as a bludgeon weapon. It has a skull and crossbones on its left arm, metal studs on the knuckles of its left hand, and a scar on the back of its right hand."
