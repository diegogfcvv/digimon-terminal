  "description": "DarknessBagramon is a Composite Digimon. It is the digifused form of AxeKnightmon and Bagramon . By uniting the dark knight and the fiendish demon lord it became the greatest emperor of evil. Its \"Imperium Vicious\", the evil power spilling out of its body, symbolizes that strength, and if a weak evil is bathed in it then it immediately becomes a grovelling subordinate. Even if you try to resist, it is considered difficult to maintain your sense of self if you are glared at by AxeKnightmon, who exists within its chest. According to one theory, it appears to be planning on destroying all good, in order to fill the world with evil and obtain a world that it can manipulate at will. Even though there are probably some Digimon whose strength is not outdone even by DarknessBagramon itself, it is said that in order to designate its plan as something guaranteed, it expands its power by bringing useful Digimon under its control, and watches out for opportunities for the opposition. Even if the opponent seems to be keeping their distance, when it becomes aware of them it will attack them with its \"God of Death Snatcher\", one of its Digimon-manipulating techniques, and for opponents whose existence has no worth, it attacks them with its \"Eternal Darkmare\". The darkness held within the hearts of humans and Digimon is intensified and fused with DarknessBagramon's own fathomless power. "
