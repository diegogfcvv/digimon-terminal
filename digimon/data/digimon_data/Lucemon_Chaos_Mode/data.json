  "description": "Lucemon Chaos Mode takes the appearance of a blue-eyed blond-haired man wearing a white bodysuit and a black overcoat. It has ten wings on its back, two on its head, and two at its neck. Its left wings are demonic, featuring black, leathery wings, while its right side has white, feathery, angelic wings save for the wing at its neck, which is dyed black. This duality references its possession of both divine and diabolic. It retains the symbols of the Zero Unit and the Digital Hazard from its Rookie stage on the plates on its left and right hand respectively. It also has a purple tattoo on the left side of its face, and wears red lipstick as makeup. Compared to Lucemon and Lucemon Shadowlord Mode , this form represents the falling of Lucifer due to his hubris in Abrahamic mythology , particularly its association with the sin of Pride."
