  "name": "Lilithmon",
  "description": "Lilithmon is a Demon Lord Digimon. With the appearance of a woman, it is one of the \" Seven Great Demon Lords \", representing the Moon and the sin of Lust . It is thought that it was originally an Ophanimon , but it fell from heaven and eventually became known as the \"Goddess of Darkness\". It confounds its opponents with its bewitchingly lovely appearance, and it is said that those who are taken in by its temptations are invariably granted death. Its reputation as the \"Goddess of Darkness\" is appropriate, as it offers generosity towards vice, but only cruel outrages towards virtue. The demonic \"Mystic Claw\" ( Nazar Nail ) on its right arm corrodes everything it touches. "
