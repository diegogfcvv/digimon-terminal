  "name": "Antylamon_(Good)",
  "description": "Antylamon (Good) is a Holy Beast Digimon. It is the \" Rabbit \" Deva , and serves the Digimon Sovereign Azulongmon . As a follower of Azulongmon, it is the owner of a gentle spirit. It likes small things, and because it attends to them with profound tenderness, if anything appears that tries to tread on them then its personality is completely reversed, and it attacks with the \"Bunny Blades\" (宝斧 Bǎo Fǔ ? , lit. \"Treasure Axes\"), transforming its hands into razor-sharp axes. Once a cut is made, it won't stop spreading until the enemy's form is no more. "
