  "name": "Minervamon",
  "description": "Minervamon is a Shaman Digimon. One of the \" Olympos XII \", it has the appearance of a maiden warrior wearing snake skin.  Though it has an extremely short physique, it possesses superhuman strength it uses to freely wield a greatsword, \" Olympia \", as large as its own body. It possesses a cheerful personality due to its childlike innocence, but when its emotions become violently unstable, it gets into a bad mood which causes selfish and willful (problematic) behavior that no one can help it cope with.
