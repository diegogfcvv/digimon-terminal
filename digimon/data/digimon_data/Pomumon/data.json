  "name": "Pomumon",
  "description": "Pomumon is a Vegetation Digimon. Although it looks like a Bird-type, it is a Vegetation Digimon whose body is packed with juice of a high sugar content like that of a fruit. For that reason, it has many natural predators such as Bird-type and Insectoid-type Digimon. Despite having wings, it is mainly active on land because its flight speed is so slow that it becomes defenseless. When it senses danger, it protects itself with \"Rapid Seed\". "
