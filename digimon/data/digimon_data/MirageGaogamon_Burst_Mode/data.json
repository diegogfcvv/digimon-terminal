  "description": "MirageGaogamon Burst Mode appears as an enhanced version of MirageGaogamon. The gold markings/symbols turn silver, while the blue armor darkens to navy. Both the knee armor and gauntlets become modified to include crescent moon shapes and slimmer designs. The spaulders become pauldrons and the cape is replaced by the arcs of energy emitted from the pauldrons. The head now includes a white horn, white hair growing from the back, and the eyes change from yellow to red. It wields a morning star-like weapon with a hook at the other end, all glowing with the same type of energy emitted from the pauldrons."
