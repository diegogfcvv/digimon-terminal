  "name": "Tyrannomon",
  "description": "Tyrannomon is a Dinosaur Digimon. It is a Digimon shaped like an ancient dinosaur from prehistoric times. Its two developed arms and massive tail mow down everything. It has intelligence and a docile personality, so it's easy to tame. This makes it handy for fledgling tamers, and many will raise one with care. It can be considered a fundamental Digimon representative.  There is a rivalry between it and fellow Dinosaur Digimon, Allomon . "
