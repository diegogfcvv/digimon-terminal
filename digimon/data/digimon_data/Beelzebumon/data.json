  "name": "Beelzebumon",
  "description": "Beelzemon is a Demon Lord Digimon. It is one of the \" Seven Great Demon Lords \", representing Venus and the sin of Gluttony . While it possesses the power to preside over the many Devil Digimon, it dares to observe a solitary existence. It is said that it could stand at the peak of the dark army, \" Nightmare Soldiers \", if it cared to, although it is also said that there exists a Demon Lord Digimon which surpasses even Beelzemon. It rides on the gigantic motorcycle-type machine, \" Behemoth \", holding its cherished shotguns, the \"Berenjena\"  ( Esp : Eggplant). Although its personality is cruel and merciless, it is also exceedingly prideful, so it would never attack the weak. "
