  "description": "Angemon draws inspiration from the mythological Angel , particularly the pop culture version. Humanoid in body and covered in holy white clothing, it has six, white, feathery wings commonly associated with angels. It has long blond hair, and its upper face is covered with a silver mask that has the Christian cross . The DigiCode on its ribbons reads デジタルモンスター ( デジタルモンスター , Dejitaru Monsutā ? , lit. \"Digital Monster\") . It also wears a long blue loincloth and four matching straps on its right leg and left arm attached. Angemon is wearing lipstick in its official art, though it is frequently depicted in other media without it."
