  "name": "Cherubimon_(Evil)",
  "description": "Cherubimon (Evil) is an Angel Digimon. It has the appearance of a beast, and uses mighty lightning techniques, whose strike is thought to be divine punishment. Angel Digimon, which are positioned at the ultimate \"Virtue\", have the aspect of their being easily stained by its antithesis of \"Vice\" as a consequence of their extremity.  It was once a member of the Celestial Digimon , but a virus caused it to turn evil,  which led it to cast a spell transforming the Spirits of Darkness from Loweemon and JagerLoweemon into Duskmon and Velgemon .   If Cherubimon (Evil) falls further, it's said it would become a Demon Lord . "
