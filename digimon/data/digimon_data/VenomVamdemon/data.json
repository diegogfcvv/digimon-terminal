  "description": "VenomMyotismon is a Dark Animal Digimon. It is a demon beast that has the lower half of a beast and an upper half with a beetle-like shell, and is the true, digivolved form of the king of darkness, Myotismon . As VenomMyotismon, who has unleashed its hidden power, it has nothing but omnicidal and destructive impulses, and Myotismon, who originally maintained its gentlemanly conduct, reason, and intelligence, hates exposing its true, ugly form.
