  "name": "Gusokumon",
  "description": "Gusokumon is a Crustacean Digimon. Gusokumon lurks at the bottom of the ocean, at a depth that light fails to reach. It is also known for being a long-lived Digimon, capable of long-term biological activity while consuming a minuscule amount of energy. Weak, injured Digimon that occasionally sink to the bottom of the ocean turn into its prey. It barely ever moves on its own accord. When facing a large number of enemies, it defends itself by firing countless Colony Torpedoes. "
