  "name": "V-dramon",
  "description": "Veedramon is a Mythical Dragon Digimon. It is a mythical Digimon that, even with the vastness of the Digital World , is said to only exist on the Folder Continent . Its existence is extremely precious, and even on the Folder Continent, it is rarely encountered. Also, it is said that only one Digimon Tamer was able to tame Veedramon. With the exception of it becoming known as Veedramon due to the \"V\"-shaped pattern on its chest, its way of life is a mystery, but for some reason, it is always mistaken for a dog. It is the owner of offensive power that is uncommon even among Champions, but if it is put into a predicament, it exhibits power that surpasses even that of Ultimates.  ExVeemon is a pure breed of Veedramon, and it is said that the variant species is Veedramon. "
