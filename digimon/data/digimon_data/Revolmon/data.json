  "name": "Revolmon",
  "description": "Deputymon draws inspiration from the Old West deputy sheriff . Its main torso is that of an oversized revolver. Its face cannot be seen except for its yellow eyes, as it is covered by a cowboy hat and red, tattered scarf. It wears blue denim pants with a bullet belt around its waist, and it wears leather gloves and boots, the latter of which feature metal spurs. It also wields a revolver in each hand."
