  "description": "Omnimon is a Warrior Digimon. One of the \" Royal Knights \", it was fused from the Virus Busters WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon due to the powerful wills of everyone who wished for goodness. It is a Digimon who has combined the special qualities of two bodies, so it is a multitype warrior which can fully demonstrate those abilities, for any given situation. It is equipped with the invincible \"Grey Sword\" and \"Brave Shield Omega\" for its WarGreymon-shaped left arm, and the \"Garuru Cannon\" and missiles for its MetalGarurumon-shaped right arm. As for the mantle on its back, it is automatically deployed when it dodges an opponent's attack, or when it is flying.  Like OmniShoutmon , upon whom it had bestowed the legendary \" Digivolution \", it possesses the power of \" Omega inForce \". "
