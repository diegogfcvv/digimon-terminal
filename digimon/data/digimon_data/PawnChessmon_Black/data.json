  "description": "PawnChessmon (Black) is a Puppet Digimon. It was born from data leaking out of a chess game supercomputer. Its power is weak, but it is promoted when it strives for prominence, and it is an ordinary pawn that conceals the mystery that it is said to possess Mega-class power. Its catchphrase is, \"I only advance!\" It considers its fellows who are striving for prominence ahead of it to be its rivals,  among them PawnChessmon (White) . "
