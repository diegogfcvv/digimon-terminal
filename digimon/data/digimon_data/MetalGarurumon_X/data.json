  "description": "MetalGarurumon X is a Cyborg Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . It has been found that it has gained additional armaments as well as upgraded sensors. In order to arm its entire body to adapt to both long- and short-distance combat, it has taken on a bipedal form, and is equipped with the gatling gun \"Metal Storm\", which has the ability to snipe over long distances, bombard a large area at mid-range, and rapid-fire extremely quickly even at short distances, boasting of overwhelming firepower. Its combined bombardment capability is more than 1.2 times that of MagnaGarurumon 's; it is basically a mass of firearms in the form of a swift beast. "
