  "name": "Rosemon",
  "description": "Rosemon is a Fairy Digimon. It has an appearance like the rose, which is said to be the queen of flowers. It has the appearance of a beautiful woman, and desires to remain beautiful forever. Its personality is more or less that way, and though it is excessively self-conscious about such things, its true strength does not in fact compare unfavorably with other Megas. It wears on its breast a \" Tifaret \",  a jewel which is engraved with the symbol of love and beauty, that is said to promise it eternal beauty and power.  It is whispered that a Rosemon was placed under a spell and turned into Babamon . "
