  "name": "Dracomon",
  "description": "Dracomon is a Dragon Digimon. It is an ancient, pure-blooded Dragon Digimon that is said to be the \"Progenitor\" of all Dramon-type Digimon. It possesses physical ability to a degree that could not be imagined from its small build, and both its power and its quick wits are top class among Rookie Digimon. Although its personality is ferocious, Dracomon can show its gentle side only to the others it has recognized. It has wings, but it is unable to fly because they are not sufficiently developed. Also, it has a nature whose primary trait is wanting to collect \"shiny things\", with an especially strange attachment to gems and metals, and it eats and assimilates its favorite things. Amongst the scales that cover Dracomon's whole body, there is one scale that is called the \"Gekirin\" ( 逆鱗 , \"Gekirin\" ? ) .  If it is touched there, Dracomon loses its mind to an excess of anger, and indiscriminately fires its \"Great Strike\". "
