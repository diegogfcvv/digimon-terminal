  "description": "Guardromon is a Machine Digimon. It is a Machine Digimon that protects the computer network's defense wall. It originally worked with the \"Net Keeper\" Giromon to repulse those who would illegally enter through the defense wall. However, malicious hackers noticed its ironclad defensive ability and infected Guardromon with a computer virus, using it to protect themselves from the vaccine-type justice brigade known as the \"Virus Busters.\" Because its program commands are basically purely defensive in nature, the change in allegiance to defending the intruders did not pose a huge problem for Guardromon.
