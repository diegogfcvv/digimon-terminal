  "name": "Deltamon",
  "description": "Deltamon is a blue bipedal dinosaur-like Digimon with red eyes, two tails, blue scales on its back, blue skin on most of its body, and white skin on its belly and nose. It has four toes on each foot, with one toe on the back of the feet, and a black claw on its toes. Its right tail has metal armor on its tip, and its left tail has the bones of its tip exposed. Deltamon has two reptilian heads on its arms, the right head having its top covered in metal armor, and the left head being a dinosaur skull. Deltamon has a \" Δ \"-shaped mark on its belly. Deltamon appears to be based the fictional King Ghidorah due to both being three-headed dragons. It also references the Δ-shape with its three heads at the letter's corners."
