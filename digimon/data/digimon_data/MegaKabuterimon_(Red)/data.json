  "description": "MegaKabuterimon (Red) is an Insectoid Digimon. It is a Digivolution of Kabuterimon that was discovered within the tropical region of the Net Area . It is almost 1.5-times the size of Kabuterimon, and is quite large among Insectoid Digimon. It is the same species as MegaKabuterimon (Blue) , and similarly, the strength of its horn, which is its main weapon, has soared, but this type of MegaKabuterimon seems to have surpassed it in flight ability. Also, muscular tissues have appeared on the bases of its forelimbs, so its grappling ability has also improved. With the exception of its survival instincts, its behavior has been observed to consist of protecting the weak, and there are even times when its behavior has appeared knight-like. "
