  "name": "Hexeblaumon",
  "description": "Hexeblaumon is a Magic Knight Digimon. It is a Digimon that only those who have mastered ice sorcery (a high-level programming language ) are able to digivolve into. It protected other Digimon until the very end during an ice age that came to the Digital World long ago, and was later rumored to have moved to another dimension, \" Witchelny \". It excels in the art of manipulating the cold, and creates various things with ice. It starts with weapons such as swords and hammers, and then other tools such as restraints that restrict the enemy's movements, and is also capable of erecting a barrier to defend itself from attacks, so it is definitely an ice professional.
