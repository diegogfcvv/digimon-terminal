  "description": "Ophanimon Falldown Mode X is a Fallen Angel Digimon and carrier of the X-Antibody . Ophanimon Falldown Mode better equipped itself to take on multiple enemies at once, such as by turning its \"Flame Hellscythe\" into a giant scythe engulfed in flames on both ends. Of note are the three \"Behead Slashers\" floating around it that help defend it against enemy attacks, as well as pursue the enemy and slice them apart. Not only that, their attack power rises significantly when they are enveloped in flames. Having gained the power to take on an entire army, it continues its extermination of the never-ending threats to justice alone. "
