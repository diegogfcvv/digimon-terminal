  "name": "Okuwamon",
  "description": "Okuwamon is an Insectoid Digimon. As a digivolution of Kuwagamon , it digivolved more balefully than Kabuterimon-species Digimon. It was enhanced with a particular focus on Kuwagamon's inferior defensive side. As for its offensive side, the reconnaissance ability of its antennae was improved, and the attack accuracy of its scissors was increased. In addition, it has been proven that it possesses not only its survival instinct but also its destructive impulses as its primary traits. It can be said that it is a more aggressive digivolved form.
