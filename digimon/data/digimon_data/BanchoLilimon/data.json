  "name": "BanchoLilimon",
  "description": "BanchoLillymon is a fairy Digimon styled after the modern Banchō , a particular type of juvenile delinquent. It has a black flower with a yellow stamen and a cross-shaped scar on its head, and its hair is made from vines. It wears a sailor fuku top, black leather skirt, black boots, and black finger-less gloves on its hands as well as pink bandages on its forearms. It has four purple leaf-like wings on its back under its red Tokkō-fuku . The characters on the Tokkō-fuku read \"Peerless\" ( 天下無敵 , Tenkamuteki ? ) and \"Distinguished\" ( 国士無双 , Kokushimusou ? ) . It wields a pair of Togemon -themed yo-yos. BanchoLillymon appears to be an homage to Sukeban Deka's Saki Asamiya, who wears a similar outfit and uses a Yoyo in combat."
