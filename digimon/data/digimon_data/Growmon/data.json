  "name": "Growmon",
  "description": "Growlmon is a Dark Dragon Digimon. It is called the \"Deep-crimson Demon Dragon\". The childishness it had when it was Guilmon has vanished, and it digivolved into a wilder, more brutal Digimon. Also, although it is a Virus Digimon, it may even battle for justice depending on how it was raised by its Tamer , because it will be faithfully obedient. Growlmon's roar has the power to shake the solid earth, and before battle, it raises its voice to an offensive roar to intimidate the opponent. "
