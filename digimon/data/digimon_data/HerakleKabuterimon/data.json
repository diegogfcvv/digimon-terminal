  "name": "HerakleKabuterimon",
  "description": "HerculesKabuterimon is an Insectoid Digimon. It digivolved with the data of Kabuterimon - and Kuwagamon-species Digimon. It has a gigantic horn and scissors, and it can be said that its form perfectly compensates for the weaknesses of those two types of Digimon, which had opposing natures. Its body shines gold, and it has regained and strengthened the flying ability which MegaKabuterimon had lost, so it rushes about the Digital World at supersonic speed. Having now accomplished this Mega digivolution, there are probably few beings who can rival HerculesKabuterimon  , the greatest of them being GranKuwagamon whose battle with it continues without ever ending.
