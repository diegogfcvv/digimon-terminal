  "name": "Gaioumon",
  "description": "Gaiomon appears to be a samurai version of BlackWarGreymon . It is a muscular black reptilian humanoid with orange eyes, silver spikey hair, three fingers on each foot, and bronzed claws on its hands and feet. It wears black tattered hakama , a bronze helmet with three white horns, bronze chest plate and leg armor, black and red layered shoulder, thigh, and groin armor, bronze leg armor, bronze and black gauntlets with a red wrist, and black fingerless gloves with an armored back. The back part of the gloves is black with a red outline with two bronze spikes on them. The shoulder and groin armors have a bronze spike on each side of the top of each layer, and each shoulder has a large white blade on its top. Each gauntlet also has a blade on the elbow. The helmet has red borders on the back and near the mouth and red stripe near each eye. The chest plate is connected to the shoulder plates through bronze track -like links, and to the thigh plates through red ropes. Gaiomon's Kikurin swords have blades curved inward near the hilt and outward near the top, and have brown hilts with another small, claw-like edge on its bottom. The Kikurin swords can be combined into a bow,  while the Digimon Pendulum X depicts Gaiomon bearing two large, three-clawed gauntlets in its hands in place of the Kikurin swords. The frontal horn and shoulder blades of Gaiomon's armor are shaped similarly to the Kikurin. Gaiomon's chestplate, frontal horn, helmet, shoulder blades, and Kikurin have As'ma Green on them."
