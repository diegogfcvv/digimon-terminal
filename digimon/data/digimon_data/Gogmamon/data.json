  "name": "Gogmamon",
  "description": "Gogmamon is a Rock Digimon. It is a Digimon with an enormous body. It is said to have a small population at present, and mostly lives in solitude deep inside caves. It hardly ever eats food that looks like food, and will occasionally leave the cave to build up energy by taking in light through the crystals covering its body. It reliably eliminates intruders inside the cave with its \"Giant Grater\". "
