  "name": "Nidhoggmon",
  "description": "Nidhoggmon is a Dark Dragon Digimon. It is a colossal Digimon that takes vast amounts of energy into its body, and is constantly overheating. The color emitted by its wings represents the extent of its overheating; the more it approaches the danger level, the redder it becomes. It repeatedly destroys and absorbs things, leaving nothing behind in its wake. "
