Its left hand ends with a BlitzGreymon head with a large gold front horn while its right hand is a CresGarurumon head. It has a rhombus red gem with a golden frame on its chest. It also has a golden spike on each side on the waist, and a gold spike on each knee. It carries the \"Garuru Sword\" on its right arm, and the \"Grey Cannon\" on its left arm; this is an inversion from the \"Grey Sword\" and \"Garuru Cannon\" of other Omegamon variants."
