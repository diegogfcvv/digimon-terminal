  "name": "Meicrackmon",
  "description": "Meicrackmon is a Beastkin Digimon. It is the digivolved form of Meicoomon . It often acts alone due to the fact that it hates conflict, in addition to its shy temperament. It is usually seen with its body curled up in sunlit areas, napping leisurely. When it senses someone drawing near, it takes cover using its keen movements and observes the situation. Although it will soften up to those who come bringing food, it will continue to lay low if they are an enemy. However, if the enemy refuses to leave its territory, it will engage them by displaying power that is unimaginable from its usual calm demeanor in order to protect its home. "
