  "name": "DarkKnightmon",
  "description": "AxeKnightmon is a Dark Knight Digimon. It is the fused figure of SkullKnightmon and Axemon , who have exchanged cups of brotherhood. AxeKnightmon, who brings the older brother's ingenuity together with the younger brother's mobility, has become a first-class warrior. The skills of AxeKnightmon, who can use the \"Twin Spear\" it wields to thrust, slash, sweep, or throw as the situation calls for, are very advanced, and it is said there are few people powerful enough to fight AxeKnightmon fairly to its face and defeat it. While AxeKnightmon possesses that much competency, it will use any means to achieve its goals and won't hesitate to get its hands dirty, and sometimes it will even be willing to betray its own comrades. AxeKnightmon, who is furnished to an implacable depth with merit, is an opponent that you don't want to turn into an enemy, if you can help it. "
