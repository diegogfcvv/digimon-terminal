  "description": "Ghostmon is a Ghost Digimon. It is often witnessed flying over graveyards. Although it does not like to show itself due to its timidness and shyness, it is a kind-hearted Digimon that helps those in need without them noticing by becoming transparent. When it comes to a battle it can't avoid, it moves about cunningly using its Little Plasma.  It is able to move through all kinds of objects. "
