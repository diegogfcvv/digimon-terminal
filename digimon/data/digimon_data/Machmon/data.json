  "name": "Machmon",
  "description": "Machmon is a Cyborg Digimon. It is a Digimon that yearns for speed. Dust clouds over barren plains are often caused by Machmon's rampaging. Although its appearance resembles that of a bike, it lacks a seat, and no one is willing to ride it. However, it thinks that it will find a Digimon destined to master it someday. It views anyone who travels at high speed as an enemy, so it is a natural-born bōsōzoku .  Occasionally, large gangs of Machmon have been witnessed roaring noisily around with Rebellimon . "
