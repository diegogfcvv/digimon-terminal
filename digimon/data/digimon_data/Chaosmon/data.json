  "name": "Chaosmon",
  "description": "Chaosmon is a Unique Digimon. Normally, when a DNA Digivolution occurs, the DigiCores of the two fellow Digimon are completely fused and are reborn as a new Digimon, but Chaosmon retains each of the DigiCores of the Digimon before the DNA Digivolution, and maintains its form in a very incomplete state. Chaosmon is the codename for Digimon who \"should not exist,\" and, according to the \" Central Dogma \" of the Digital World , are absolutely impossible singularities ( bugs ). Due to its extremely unstable existence, its lifespan is very brief, and it is conjectured that its lifespan was shortened as a result of running the program that eliminates the bugs released by the Digital World's managing system. This Chaosmon is believed to be one that was DNA digivolved from BanchoLeomon and Darkdramon , and the faces of each Digimon are visible on its arms. The \"Ban-Tyo Blade\" is equipped to its \"Bancho Arm\", and the \"Gigastick Cannon\" is equipped to its \"Darkdra Arm\". "
