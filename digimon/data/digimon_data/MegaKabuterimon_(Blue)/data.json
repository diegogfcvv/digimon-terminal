  "name": "MegaKabuterimon_(Blue)",
  "description": "MegaKabuterimon (Blue) is an Insectoid Digimon. It is a Digivolution of Kabuterimon that was discovered within the tropical region of the Net Area . It is almost 1.5-times the size of Kabuterimon, and is quite large among Insectoid Digimon. While its flight abilities have regressed to a certain extent, the strength of its horn, which is its main weapon, has soared. Also, muscular tissues have appeared on the bases of its forelimbs, so its grappling ability has also improved. With the exception of its survival instincts, its behavior has been observed to consist of protecting the weak, and there are even times when its behavior has appeared knight-like. "
