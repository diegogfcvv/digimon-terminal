  "name": "Bagramon",
  "description": "Bagramon's design is likely derived from the mythological Samael . It is a white-haired, bearded man with dark skin, five red horns on its head, and eight small black wings. On the right side of its body, it has a long, skeletal arm, a clawed leg, and a skeletal half-mask with a ruby in the place of the eye, each of which is carved from the wood of King Drasil . It wears white clothes with a golden chest-plate and a white mantle."
