  "name": "Centarumon",
  "description": "Centarumon draws directly from its namesake centaur , with a humanoid upper body and a horse-like lower body. The majority of its body is covered with orange fur, but its muscles are covered in a blue plating. It wears a helmet that reveals only its red monoeye, and it only wears a shoulder guard on its left arm. Its left hand is metallic with a chain dangling from its wrist, while its right arm is a cannon."
