  "description": "Jazamon is a Bird Dragon Digimon. It is a Machine Digimon shaped like a bird. Although it is capable of gliding from high places using its wings, it is unable to uplift itself by flapping them. As it is quite timid and very cautious, it is wary of objects that move in its surroundings regardless of whether it is day or night. "
