  "name": "Rhinomon",
  "description": "Rhinomon is a Mammal Digimon. It armor-digivolved through the power of the \" Digi-Egg of Miracles \". It is clad in armor made of Chrome Digizoid , and this armor cannot be destroyed even by laser-based attacks let alone physical attacks due to its surface becoming reflective while at the same time becoming bulky armor. Also, although it looks as if it is sluggish, it moves its body by using its excess power, so it is able to travel quickly to the point of being abnormal, contrary to its build. "
