  "name": "Herissmon",
  "description": "Herissmon is a bipedal Digimon that resembles a hedgehog. It has light blue eyes, a black snout, ears, white fur, large red claws, and a small tail. Its feet have two digits, and its hand have three. Herissmon's thumbs are its only clawless digits. Herissmon has a zigzag-shaped mouth and yellow marks on its belly and under its eyes. It also has grey spiky—mimicking a hedgehog's spikes—on its back, around its neck, under its ears, on the back of its head, and from the top of its head until its snout. The larger strings of fur on the top of its head are yellow, and fur under its ears also has yellow tips."
