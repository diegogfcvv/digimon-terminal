  "description": "SnowAgumon is a Dinosaur Digimon. It is a separate species of Agumon that inhabits snowy fields. Due to the mischievousness it inherited from Agumon, it is always happily excited like a child when it snows. Because the color of its body is identical to that of snow, in battle, it is able to approach the enemy to attack without being exposed. "
