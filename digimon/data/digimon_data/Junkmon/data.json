It creates a comfortable environment by disassembling the surrounding structures. If a factory one is familiar with disappears before they know it, then a large number of Junkmon may be responsible. When it discovers invading enemies, it will drive them away with its \"Parabolic Junk\". Persistent opponents will suffer its \"Scrap Teeth\". "
