  "name": "Entmon",
  "description": "Entmon is a Vegetation Digimon. It is a Digimon with a body woven and fused together from decayed trees. Its whole body is corroded in several places, and mold grows on parts where the bark is exposed. Its body is packed with a large number of insects, acting as the muscles that move its body around. It is very terrifying to see the insects spill out of the joints all over its body each time it takes off with its dead leaf wings. "
