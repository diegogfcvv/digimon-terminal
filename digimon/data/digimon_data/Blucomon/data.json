  "name": "Blucomon",
  "description": "Bulucomon is a Mini Dragon Digimon. Bulucomon resides in areas isolated from the outside world by ice. Its physical strength has been tempered by cold, harsh environments, allowing it to lift objects larger than itself with ease. However, because its body is made mainly out of ice, its body will shrink and its power will weaken when exposed to high temperatures. Due to being brought up in areas with small populations, they will tend to form very strong bonds even with Digimon of different species that they encounter. It is especially close to Penguinmon  and Gabumon  . Bulucomon will melt and shrink with its power decreased like Paledramon does when encountering enemies of the like of Meramon . "
