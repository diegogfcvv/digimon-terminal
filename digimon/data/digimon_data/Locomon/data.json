  "name": "Locomon",
  "description": "Locomon is a mechanical Digimon that bears a strong resemblance to a streamlined steam locomotive. Its body is clad in blue metal and its face is hidden by a metal mask-like piece, which has openings showing its yellow eyes, with a lamp on its forehead and orange buffers on a bumper with a coupler between them. It has arms on the sides of its front end, with pauldron-like sections of perforated metal shielding its shoulders and large hands that each have three claw-shaped fingers. It also has a cab at its rear, enabling another Digimon to operate it if necessary. Its wheels are arranged in a 2-6-4 configuration."
