  "description": "BanchoLeomon is a Beastkin Digimon. It lives faithfully only to the \"Justice\" in which it trusts. It is said that only Digimon who continue to emerge victorious in battles with fierce champions, without their spirit being \"broken\", are able to acquire the title of \" Bancho \", and in the recorded history of the Digital World , only five Digimon which possess this title have been confirmed. As it is a boss that only serves its own \"Justice\", if something becomes an obstacle to that \"Justice\", it will see them as \"Evil\", even if they are a being like the Royal Knights or the Celestial Digimon , and they will become an enemy that it has to eliminate. The \" Gaku-Ran \" ( GAKU-RAN ) worn over its shoulders is endowed with a defensive function that negates 89.9% of the opponent's physical strikes. It wields its prided tantō , \"Otokodama\" ( 男魂 , \"Otokodama\" ? lit. \"Man's Soul\") . "
