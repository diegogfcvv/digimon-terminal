  "description": "ChaosGallantmon is a Dark Warrior Digimon. It is another form of Gallantmon which has awoken to its instincts as a Virus-species. Its heart and thoughts are completely tainted by the Dark Side ,  and it is nothing more than the \" Digital Hazard \" that brings calamity to the Digital World . According to one theory, Megidramon and ChaosGallantmon are the same being, and it is said that whether that wave of terror is projected as a dark knight or as a dark dragon depends on the observer.  It is clad in black, demonic armor refined from high purity Chrome Digizoid just like Gallantmon, and its right hand can become the demonic lance \" Balmung \" while its left hand can become the demonic shield \" Gorgon \". It is definitely a being set in opposition to Gallantmon. "
