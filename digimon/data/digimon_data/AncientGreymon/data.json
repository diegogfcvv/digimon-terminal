  "name": "AncientGreymon",
  "description": "AncientGreymon appears to be a mish-mash of both Agunimon and BurningGreymon , its form containing physical features from the Human and Beast Spirit Digimon of Flame. It has BurningGreymon's face, torso, legs, and flaming wings. Then it has Agunimon's shoulder guards, arms and feet to form its front limbs, and it has Agunimon's long spiky hair. What appears to be the Rudriya Darpaá¹‡a is attached to both sides of its body. It sports glowing, blue eyes. In contrast to AncientGarurumon , it is a quadruped. The D-Scanner (Toy) depicts AncientGreymon without any wings."
