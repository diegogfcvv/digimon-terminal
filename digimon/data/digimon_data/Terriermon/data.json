  "description": "Terriermon is a cute  bipedal canine with white fur that is striped with green on its collarbone, paws, and the tips of its ears. Its most prominent features are its long, frayed ears and the solitary horn on in its forehead. Like a dog, it has black toes and pawpads. While it is primarily reminiscent of a dog, it necessarily shares design elements with its twin species, Lopmon , who is reminiscent of a rabbit."
