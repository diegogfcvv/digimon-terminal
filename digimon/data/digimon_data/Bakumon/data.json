  "name": "Bakumon",
  "description": "Tapirmon's design is derived from the Malayan Tapir ( Tapirus indicus ) and the mythical, dream-eating baku of Japanese mythology. It is a tapir-like Digimon with brown and purple fur, blue eyes, and two tusks. It has a smoke in place of legs, making it resemble a genie . It wears a Holy Ring on its left-leg and a gray metallic helmet with golden symbols in it."
