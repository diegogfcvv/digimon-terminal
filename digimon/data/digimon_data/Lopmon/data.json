  "name": "Lopmon",
  "description": "Lopmon is a cute  bipedal lagomorph with brown fur that is striped with pink on its collarbone, paws, and the tips of its ears. Its most prominent features are its long, frayed ears and three horns on in its forehead. Like a dog, it has black toes and pawpads. While it is primarily reminiscent of a rabbit, it necessarily shares design elements with its twin species, Terriermon , who is reminiscent of a dog."
